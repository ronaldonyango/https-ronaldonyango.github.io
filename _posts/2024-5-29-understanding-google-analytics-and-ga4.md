## What is Google Analytics?

Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. It was launched in November 2005 and has since become one of the most widely used analytics tools on the web. Google Analytics provides detailed statistics and analytics about website visitors, including how they found the site, how they navigate through it, and how they interact with content.

## Introducing GA4

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the latest version of Google Analytics, introduced in October 2020. GA4 represents a significant shift from the previous Universal Analytics platform, focusing on a more user-centric approach and leveraging machine learning to provide deeper insights.

### Main Features of GA4

1. **Event-Based Tracking**: Unlike Universal Analytics, which is session-based, GA4 tracks events. This allows for more flexible and detailed tracking of user interactions on your site.

2. **Enhanced User Insights**: GA4 uses machine learning to provide predictive insights about user behavior and conversions. This helps you understand potential future actions of your users.

3. **Cross-Platform Tracking**: GA4 can track users across websites, apps, and other platforms, providing a more holistic view of user interactions.

4. **Privacy-Focused**: GA4 includes enhanced privacy controls, such as cookieless tracking and more granular data controls, aligning with global privacy regulations.

5. **Improved Reporting**: GA4 offers a new reporting interface with customizable reports and detailed user journey analysis, making it easier to find the insights you need.
